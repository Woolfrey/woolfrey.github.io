### Types of Human Error



## Poka Yoke (ポカヨケ) : Mistake Proofing

### Rules for a good Poka Yoke Device

1. Mistakes are prevented from occuring, or the process is prevented from continuing if one occurs.
2. It is applied to 100% of items or events, not just a random sample.
3. There is an immediate return of investment.

A good rule of thumb for the 3rd is that the cost of the device is less than the cost of defects over 1 financial year.
