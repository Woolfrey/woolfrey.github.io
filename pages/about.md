My name is Jon. I have an affinity for solving complex problems. I'm a mechanic by trade , have a PhD in robotics , and am a [Lean Six Sigma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_Six_Sigma) Black Belt. I'm also interested in topics such as design, philosophy, classical mechanics, (applied) mathematics, and science. My interests are diverse, but I think the common theme is my aptitude for raciocination (logical thinking), and spatial reasoning.

I also like:
- Good coffee :coffee:
- Books :books: (check out my reading list [here](/reading/))
- Solving problems :jigsaw:
- Optimisation :cyclone:
- Board games :game_die::chess_pawn:
- Cats :cat2:

I've also taken a liking to cooking in the past few years.

### :hourglass_flowing_sand: A Bit of History

I went to high school at St Mary's Cathedral College, Sydney (Australia) from 2000 to 2005. From 2001 onwards I chose Visual Arts as an elective. It was my favourite subject (and still is!). I also did Extension 1 English, and loved studying classic literature such Bram Stoker's _Dracula_, and Mary Shelley's _Frankenstein_ (hence my passion for reading). I also did Extension 1 Maths, though I didn't enjoy it so much.

When I left high scool I went to the College of Fine Arts at the University of New South Wales (now UNSW Art & Design). I hated it, so I quit within 6 months and did an apprenticeship as a mechanic instead (fitting & machining to be precise). I turned out to have knack for fixing things. And, because I worked in a factory surrounded by robots, I decided to go study engineering.

I was terrified of failing (maths wasn't my best subject in high school), so I studied extremely hard. I ended up getting top marks in most of my subjects. I realised I had the potential to pursue a PhD. I was fortunate to go straight from my Bachelor's degree to PhD. In 2020 was awarded my doctorate and have been doing research in robotics since.

Simultaneously, whilst doing my bachelor's degree, I received a scholarship to work with Transport for New South Wales (TfNSW) and I became involved with the [Lean Six Sigma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_Six_Sigma) and Continuous Improvement methodology. I earned my Six Sigma Green Belt whilst working for Sydney Trains. I later completed the Black Belt course with the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) Business School during my doctorate.

 I am currently with the [STORM Lab](https://www.stormlabuk.com/) at the University of Leeds. I am also a guest lecturer and teaching assistant for the Lean Six Sigma [Yellow Belt course](https://www.edx.org/certificates/professional-certificate/tumx-six-sigma-and-lean?webview=false&campaign=Lean+Six+Sigma+Yellow+Belt%3A+Quantitative+Tools+for+Quality+and+Productivity&source=edx&product_category=professional-certificate&placement_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.edx.org%2Fcertificates%2Fprofessional-certificate) by the Technical University of Munich (TUM) on [edX.org](https://www.edx.org/).

### :world_map: Places I've Lived

I'm originally from Sydney, Australia. I lived there until I was 34 years old.

Due to the COVID lockdowns and border closures, the Australian universities lost revenue. My contract as a research associate / post doc was not renewed. I had 2 choices: change careers, or find a job abroad. I was fortunate to receive an offer at the _Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia_, in Genova, Italy. I lived there for about 2.5 years, and is still my favourite place.

I am now currently living in Leeds, England. The weather isn't as nice :cold_face:, but the Yorkshire countryside is stunning in Spring and Summer.
